To build the files for these disks, you'll need three programs.  One, obviously, is CBM prg studio.  The other is DirMaster, or some other program that lets you copy files into a blank .D64 image.  The last is either an emulator to run the disks on, or a program to copy the images to real floppies.

The first step is to setup the System disk.  To do this, load CBM prg studio and select the menu options Build->Project->To File to Generate .prg files.  If any Assembly files give you an extra window "Assembly Dump", you can just hit the X to close this and ignore it.

The next step is to copy the files for the System disk into a .D64 image, in the order shown above.  Please note that MOST of the files will need to be renamed after they are copied into the image.  Many of the files are prefixed with the PETSCII character for the english Pound sign, represented above by "{pound}".  You will need to add this character to those files when creating the .D64 disk image. It can be typed in DirMaster using Show PETSCII Tool menu option.  The file "main-ml" should be renamed to "v3.7 ml1", and "interrupts.ml" should be renamed to "v3.7 ml2", for example. Any SEQ (,s) file mentioned above will be found in the project "data" directory.

The next step is to copy the files for the Sample Data disk into a .D64 image, in the order shown above.  Some you built for the System disk in step 1, but most are in the data directory.  Please note that ALL of the files will need to be renamed after they are copied into the image.  The data files are prefixed with the PETSCII character for the english Pound sign, represented above by "{pound}".  You will need to add this character to those files when creating the .D64 disk image.

The last step is to either load up your emulator, or copy the images to real floppies, and get to work. Check the project "docs" directory for ascii instructions on configuring and using the system.
