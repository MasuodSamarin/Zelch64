READY.
RUN
                                        
This program is the loader program for
the ML files and your BBS program. It
should be loaded from your system disk
every time you put up your BBS.

   Answer all time/data questions 
completely.(Answering "Y" to the
printer on prompt forces a general
log of people who have called to be
sent to device 4, secondary device 7.)

   Military time should not be used in
the prompts and single digits where 
possible should be used.

---------------------------------------
-----------WAITING-FOR-CALL------------
---------------------------------------

   When you see this screen, the BBS
is waiting for a call. If you have
a smartmodem, the board will wait
for one ring before answering. 1650
and 1660s will answer as soon as the
faint glimmering of a ring is
detected.

            Monster Mode
            ************

   Between the time of 11:00pm and
12:59am the BBS must go through 
this mode. First this will count        
he number of users and re-create
the \calls file. This resets the
number of calls each user has made
that day. Next it will validate the
most widly edited disk, drive 8.
Lastly, it will increment the day
and month is necessary.

             F1 - MENU                  
             *********

1) Return to BBS - this is a sub-reset.
It will return you to the waiting for
call screen.

2) Monster mode- same as above except 
the date is not changed.

3) Zelch (Zap) term- this is a simple
term. The program default is GFX
mode, Hit F3 to toggle GFX/ASCII.
F2 brings you to the Zelch terminal
menu. At the "CMD:" you can type:
Q-This preforms a complete RESET.
B-Change from 200-500 baud.
T-Return to terminal mode.
U-Upload seq or prg.
D-Download seq or prg.
4) Feedback. This is for viewing
the \feedback file.
5) Log. This views the \Log! file.

---------------------------------------
-------------F3--LOGON-----------------
---------------------------------------
 
     The first prompt to hit return
decides if anyone is really on.
Next it asks if you are using 
standard ASCII or COMMODORE GFX.
Now it shows the opening msg and
asks you for your ID#. The BBS
will ask this 5 times. If after 5 trys,
you have not entered a correct ID and
password, the BBS will assume you
are a hacker and reset.
     After you have entered your
ID and PASSWORD, the board will load
the rest of your info, set up the
window and print your stats. The
window at the top of the screen will
not change after you have logged on,
even if you change the access level
or logoff time on-line.
     After the stats are printed,
it will search for the file "\newsfile"
if found, that file will be viewed.


         ONE-TOUCH-COMMANDS
         ******************

     F1- Enter chat mode. This
is entered from anywhere the keyboard
is read. Chat mode is signaled by
reverse typing and will not announce
itself. F7 exits.

     F3- From prompts which only require
one key, you can hit this button and 
raise the current users access
temporarily. Answering "Y" to the
BURST TIME prompt gives the current
user two hours on-line starting
at the current time
                                        
     F2- Autologoff. Pressing this
key will tell the BBS that the current
user has ran out of time (even if
he hasn't).
                                        
             LOGOFF
             ******
                                        
     There are two types of logoff:
the RESET and the FULL logoff. The
RESET is preformed only if a user
has not fully logged on. All other
times, the BBS will give a FULL logoff.
The first things the BBS does in this
logoff is send the Time Up msg (if they
have run out of time or dropped carrier)
. Next it sends the \closing msg
file to the screen and sends the
logoff info to the printer if
necessary. Now it saves the users
information and prints the Bye
msg. In 1650 versions, the BBS
hangs up here, but on other versions,
the waiting for call screen hangs up.
Lastly it saves the "LOG" and 
"last caller" info and preforms a
RESET. In moments, you are back at
the waiting for call screen.

               LOG
               ***
                                        
   The Log starts when the BBS
records, in memory, the logon
time and the person logging on.
After logged on, the following
info can be read from this file:

cmd:m

  This means that the user has
pressed "m" at the COMMAND prompt.
Lets assume that's the character to
go to your message base and see
what couldbe typed next.

msg:q

  This means the user has typed
"q" at the Sig prompt. Other
possible entrys are:

vote

   The user has voted.

ul:text,s,w

   The user has uploaded the
SEQ file "text"

dl:game,p,r

   The user has downloaded the
PRG file "game". The log can be
read in two ways. From the waiting
for call menu and from the
SysOp disk channel (explaned below)
The log filename is "\Log!"
                                        
           NEWUSER                      
           *******                      
                                        
   The user that types "new" at
the ID prompt will go thru the new
user process. The first thing the
process does is find an empty user
account to store the new info into.
Next it asks some questions for 
the users permanant records
This information as well as more
are available for editing in the
SysOp section (explained below).
After the user has entered the
preliminary questions, they will
have their record saved twice and
the "\newuser" file will be shown.
Now, the secondary questions will
ba asked. These are SysOp definable.
The questions are stored in the
file "\newqs" and questions are
retrieved one at a time. Up to 10
can be used and written questions
should not have lines skipped
between them. Here is an example
"\newqs" file:

^What is your State    :
^What is your City     :
^What is your Area Code:
^What is your hobby    :
                                        
   The "^" or any nonsence character
should be inserted before each
question. The character will
not be viewed by the new user.
Answers to these questions are
stored in the file "\newinfo".
   Lastly, the user must go thru
the logon process again. Except
that this time, his record is on
disk and he can log on as a level
0 user.


---------------------------------------
---------------COMMAND-----------------
---------------------------------------
                                        
   The following commands are available
from the COMMAND prompt. The prompt
itself will have a box linked to it
if the user is using color gfx, and
will stop at the colon if they are not.
                                        
               INFO                     
               ****

  Choosing this option simply
alows the user to view the file
"\info".

             FEEDBACK                   
             ********

  This alows the user to leave 
personal user-to-sysop feedback.
All feedback is linked to the file
"\feedback". The SysOp can also
recieve mail. Feedback can be
read in the same places the Log
can.

               OFF?                     
               ****
   Here is the logoff request. if
the user types "y" at this prompt
the BBS will log the user off. It
will make a feedback request first
though.

               PAGE!                    
               *****

  If a user wants to chat with you,
he will call this routine. This
routine first turns the border
to a blinding white and then 
"Makes Noises" to alert the SysOp
that a user wants to chat.

             USERLIST
             ********

  This is to view the \members"
file. This file will contain a list
of all users but must be kept up to
date by the SysOp. New users are
not added to this list. See the
SysOp section to find out how to
keep this file updated.
  At the prompt, a user can enter the
first characters of a name for the
userlist routine to match.

              STATUS
              ******
                                        
   Here is the current status of
the user on-line. Unlike the window,
this record is always accurate.

              SYSOP!                    
              ******

  This is the SysOp section and
is for preforming the various
jobs of the sysop. The following
commands are available.

D)isk Channel.
   This is a direct link to your
disk drive. The default device
is 8 but can be changed by typing
in the new device number and hitting
return. Hitting return on a blank
line exits this function. All DOS
commands are available here including
the following EXTRA commands.

   w:filename
 This is the seq file writer. It
simply brings you to the msg maker.
If you save the message you type 
there, it will scratch this filename
and re-write it as the filename
you entered.

   e:filename
 A more complicated seq filewriter,
this routine first reads the file
into memory, then goes to the
message maker.If you save your
message maker file, it will scratch
and re-write the filename given.

   @
 This will give you an instant
look at the error channel of the
current device. If your light
starts blinking inside another
part of the BBS, rush here and
type "@"(return). The error
will then be viewed.
   $
 This shows you a complete directory
of the current disk drive.
   $:\mail*
 This shows you a directory of
all mail. Where "\mail" is can be
any argument.
   %
  This counts the number of files
on the current device.
   %:\mail*
 This counts the number of pieces
of mail on the current drive. Where
"\mail" is can be any argument.

L)ist users - list is the same as
the userlist above.

E)dit users - this allows the editing
of certain aspects of any users record
(except the user currently on-line).
Remember, there are character limits
to all pieces of information.
Each user has 10 variables in their
record numbered 0-9. Only 0-5 are
used right now. They are used in
the following way:
0 - LSB of the highest msg
    read by this user
1 - MSB of the highest msg
    read by this user
2 - Default Baud rate

3 - Uploads

4 - Downloads

5 - Sig this user is a SigOp of.
    (or 100 if a SysOp)

R)eset Vote Box - this is for
resetting the file "\vote box".
After this file is reset, users
can now vote again even if they have
already voted and all results are
reset back to 0.
V)ote editor - this is for editing
the file "\vote". The following
information can be edited.
  Title- the simple title of the
         vote subject
  Response # - the number of
               possible voting
               choices.
  Option - the accual choice that
           the user is given.
  Result - a look at the results
           of this Option. Only
           9 (1-9) options/results
           can be entered.
           ex:
           Option: yes
           Result: voted yes.
  Q-quits S-Saves/Quits 


M)embers file creater - this
option is for the creation of
the \members file from the accual
userlist. Empty records will not
be entered.
T)ime/Date editor - this is similiar
to the questionare in the loader
program. All entrys are permanent 
(until they are edited again).
                                        
               EMAIL                    
               *****

  This section is for the sending and
recieving of Electronic mail.
The following commands are available.
R)ead and delete mail - users can
also reply to the mail recieved.
U)serlist - same as COMMAND userlist.
S)end mail - this option is for the
sending of mail to another user.
The entry may be empty (with
a handle of "EMPTY") but not
unrecorded. The user can also send
mail to himself. All mail is linked
to the file "\mail X". Where X is
the ID number of the person with
mail.


            Message Base                
            ************
                                        
    This is the most important
part of your BBS where ideas,
information, and fun is posted on
easy to read bulletins and responses.
                                        
    Apon entering a Sig, the BBS
shows the file "\sigmsg X". X is the
sig number minus 1. (ex "\sigmsg 0" =
the opening file for Sig 1). Next
it reads the information for each posted
msg from the file "\Sig X". X works the
same way here as in the sigmsg. 
                                        
    Once in the msg base, the following
commands are available:


RETURN - hitting return lets you view
the next msg. For more about reading
msgs, see READ below.
CHANGE SIGS - this lets you change
to another sig. The user must have
access to that sig to enter it.
LIST SIGS - this views all sigs that
the user has access to. Sigs with
high accesses should be places near
the end of the list.
SCAN MSGS - this lists the number
of replys as well as the header of
all msgs posted in that sig. The
Space bar aborts here as in all msgs.
The home key pauses messages.
READ MSGS - this function is for
the viewing of msgs and replys in
the current sig. The first thing
this process does is to show the
bulletin itself. If the bulletin
has no responses, the routine skips
to the reply prompt below. If the
bulletin has replys, it will now
show the reply prompt. Here, the
user has a choice of reading the
replys starting at the first
one,quiting to the reply prompt,
skip replys to begin reading
further on, or press RETURN (same
as pressing "r").REPLY PROMPT - if
the user has post access, he will
now be asked if he would like to
reply to the msgs he has just read.
Replys are tagged to the end of
the message. A message replyed to
will recieve a higher assigned
number. When the reply is fixed,
(signaled by the "Fixing" message)
the routine stores the new information
for that msg on the "\Sig" file for
that sig.
POSTING - When a message is posted,
many things occur, first, the
program checks to see if the post
would go beyond the allowed number
of msgs for that sig. If so, then
the message, when fixed, will be
posted over the first message and
so the cycle begins again. The
message is then allowed to be posted,
and when Fixed, will have a higher
number assigned to it (the number
for the next posted msg is stored in
the "\last caller" file) and a reply
number of "0" is stored. Messages
posted appear as "\msg X Y". X is
the sig number minus one and Y
is the message number.
NEW MSGS - this views new messages
to the user in that sig only.
ALL NEW - starting with the
current sig, the routine jumps
to sig after sig, preforming
the NEW MSGS routine above where
necessary. This routine will stop
when it trys to enter a Sig which
has a higher access then the current
user.
DELETE MSGS - this is for the deleting
of an entire message in that sig.
All replys are deleted also. This
and the next routine are available
to SubOps and people who's
variable number 5 is equal to
100. Neither people can enter
these routines tho if their access
is too low.
REPLY DELETE - this routine first
restores the bulletin being dissected
and then allows the SubOp to resave
each reply (or not resave, thus
deleting it).

         Transfer Section
         ****************
                                        
   Here is where users can send
and recieve program or sequential
files using the New 8-bit Punter
protocol.
   The following commands are
available:
                                        
DIRECTORY - give a directory of
the current UD section. Files can
have up to 14 characters and are
stored on disk with the filename
given except the first letter
in the filename is the current UD
code. "@filename" means that
"filename" has been uploaded to
UD #1. "afilename" means that
"filename" has been uploaded to
UD #2 and etc.

UPLOAD - Users choosing this option
can upload a file to the current
UD. Before the tramsfer, the user
may enter a download description
of the file for others to view (see
below). After the transfer , the
program check disk space on the
current UD drive. If that drive
now has less then 20 blocks, the
system will scratch the uploaded
file (not the description), and
validate the disk. 

DOWNLOAD - Users will download
access can download any file in
te current UD. As in the UPLOAD,
the user has 40 seconds to go to
RECIEVE or SEND mode in his terminal
before the system aborts. They may
also type "a" before the transfer
begins to ABORT.

LIST UDs - this views the UD
section the current user has access
to.

CHANGE UDs - this lets the user change
to any other UD section he has
access to.

ABOUT FILE - this lets the user
view the download description of
any file in the current UD.Descriptions
will appear on your disk as 
"^"+CURRENT UD CODE (see DIRECTORY)
+"filename".

               VOTE!
               *****

  Here is where the current user can
vote on the current voting subject.
A user can only vote once untill
the vote box is reset and the results
are viewed in numeric as well
as percentage.

           BAUD CHANGE
           ***********

  This alows the current user that
is not at 1200 baud to change his
baud rate to any rate between
200 and 500.

          LIBRARY SECTION!
          ****************
                                        
  This is just an over simplified
message base. Messages are read as
text files. The menu is on disk
as "\txt 0" and all other text files
appear on disk as "\txt "+text file
number.

           VARIABLES?!?!?
           **************

   A new feature, the user can
now edit certain aspects of their
status. The PASSWORD, their
HIGHEST MESSAGE READ (lowering this
makes earlier messages new again),
and their DEFAULT BAUD RATE. The
default baud rate is any baud rate
between 200 and 500. If this rate
is greater then the current baud
rate, then the system will prompt
you to change to this rate after
the news file is read.

                                        
   I hope you enjoy the program.
