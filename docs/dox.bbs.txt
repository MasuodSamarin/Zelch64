   Set up ALL equipment with data disks 
in their proper places. The exception   
to this is that you have your system    
disk in drive 8.

   Press return from here and answer    
the time and date questions.The time is 
NOT in military time and single or      
double digits are acceptable. If you    
have a printer (device 4) and would     
like a logon and logoff recorded,       
answer "y" to this question, otherwise, 
press return or "n".                    
                                        
   After the program is loaded, switch  
your SYSTEM disk for your MAIN data     
disk and press return. Make sure you    
have your modem in ANSWER and DATA.     
This is the "waiting for call" screen.  
This is displayed untill a person calls 
and is on-line. Notice the last caller  
and the logoff time are recorded as     
well as the # of calls since you last   
turned on the computer.This number is   
reset in MONSTER MODE (mentioned in     
part 1). Press F1.                      
1) Return to BBS - this returns to the  
waiting for call screen.                
2) Monster Mode - this resets the       
number of calls for that day, the day,  
month (if needed) , resets the calls    
today and validates the MAIN data disk. 
3) Zelch or Zap - term. This is a       
simple  terminal without any form of    
extras. Once in Term mode, F3 toggles   
ascii/commodore, and F2 exits to BBS    
mode.

   Go thru the logon process untill the 
opening msg is displayed. The space bar 
aborts a msg and the home key pauses    
(any other resumes).                    
   Enter your ID#: (probably 1)         
   Enter your password: (All upper and  
lowercases exactly the way you wrote it 
before.)

BBS throws you off. If you have no ID   
#, then type "new" and go thru the      
newuser process.

and will not scroll off the screen      
untill logoff is accomplished.

exits. Be sure to note where you came

itself.                                 
F2- auto-throw off. This will set the

of time, or is F2'd.                    
F3- from some one-letter prompts. This  
allows you to make a simple access      
change. Remember to set it back to its  
original value before the person logs   
off or it will be saved in the persons  
user record.
