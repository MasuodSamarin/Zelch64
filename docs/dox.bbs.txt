Welcome to the world of COMMODORE 
BBS's with the Zelch BBS program
by Bo Zimmerman.

  This system operates on a COMMODORE
64 or any compatible, a serial
printer, up to four disk drives
(numbered 8-11), and a auto answer
modem (1650 or compat,1660 or compat,
1670 or compat.)
  The BBS will operate at any hours
although a 24 hour system is preferred.

    SETTING UP!
---------------
Your BBS will consist of at least
two disks. The SYSTEM DISK, and
the MAIN DATA DISK. The System
disk holds all the programs that
you load to set up your bbs. The
main data disk holds all files 
necessary during its operation. 
You will find that you already have
a copy of both disks. The system
disk should remain unnotched and
unchanged while the main data disk
stays notched and contains some         
example files which may be changed
as needed.Below is a list of all
files that are found on your
main data disk and other data disks
as well. Some files appear at once and
some accumulate during the operation
of the BBS.

"\userlog" - this is a REL file
 holding the major information
 about all users. This file will
 grow in size as your number of
 users grow.
"\calls" - this is another REL file
 holding a record of the # of calls
 made by each user that day. This file
 grows also but at a much slower rate.

 as soon as a user connects to the BBS
 Just before he enters his ID#.
"\closing msg" - viewed when a user
 logs off your bbs.

 level from 0 - 9. This is a menu of
 the options obtainable from the
 MAIN COMMAND LEVEL.
"\msg X Y" - X = Sig number minus 1. Y=
 the msg number. This is a file holding
 a msg and its replys. All of which
 are posted from your msg base.
"\sigmsg X" - X=Sig number .This

----------                              
LOAD "EDITOR 2.5",8

SEARCHING FOR EDITOR 2.5
LOADING
READY.
type RUN and insert your main data
disk into drive 8.
now press 1.
Here is the editor for the information
held in the "\variables" file.
N)ame of BBS - name of your BBS
L)ibrary device - device to hold
your library or text files.
MODEM - type of modem using.
M)ail device - device to hold 
user to user mail.
C)ommand - editor for the individual
functions available from the main

you may want to view to learn more
about before changing) may be changed.
The letter required to reach that
option and the access level or higher
to use that option.
+)MSG MKR - ABOVE for Message writer
-)UD - ABOVE for UD
\)Msg Base - ABOVE for Message Base

S)ig System - an editor for the number
of msg bases you have. And for
each individual SIG, the name of
the SIG (usually describing its use),
the access level required to go
into that SIG, the device # on which
msgs for that sig will appear, and
the max number of Messages (not
counting responses to msgs) for
each sig. If more msgs are posted than
allowable by the last function, then
the system will recycle the msgs.
U)D - ABOVE for UD
P) - ABOVE for ON-LINE PROGRAM section
or the SUBSECTION. After you have 
edited this section. Use the "C"
function to create a seq file
comtaining the number of programs

This (C) option should be used
whenever you add an on-line prg.
T)ime/Calls - the number of calls
per day and minutes per call allowed
for each access level.
@)Modem - type of modem you use.
^) Color cycle editor. Each line
outputed in the BBS that has been
defined to honor the color cycle will

will be depends on the colors you
choose. Choose a color to edit
and use the CNTRL-NUMBER and C=
NUMBER keys to change colors.
(ex C=3 to change to red.)
Q)uit - leave this section of the
editor without saving your changes.
*)Save and quit - leave this sectin
of the editor after saving the
changes made.
------Now type (Q) or (*) and then
2. This section edits your user
log. Your may create a new user
log, deleteing all old entrys therin.
Edit,View,Add users or exit.
It is more preferable to edit users
from within the BBS. This is a 
sloppy user editor.

----now type "5"
The last function is very neccessary.
Whenever you have decided on how
many sigs you want and the number
of msgs in each sig. You will then
come to this section and create a
"\Sig" file for each sig. After you
have created a record file for each
sig, do NOT use this function again
unless you have deleted al the msgs
in the sig and wish to change the Max
msgs in that sig (first fom the option
1 editor), or if you have added a new
sig and wish to create a record file
for it. Make sure the sig has
already been created in the option 1
editor.!!!

  After all this is soaked up, you
are ready to look at the BBS itself.
Load "Zelch",8 and run it.
This is the loader program for
the BBS. Press RETURN and answer
all the preliminary questions. Typing
"y" to the Printer On? option forces
a list of users who have called and
when they logged on and off to be
sent to the printer while a user
is online.
After all the questions are answered,
just sit back and wait for the BBS
to LOAD.                                
  When you get the insert data disk
prompt, insert all data disks into
their promper drives. Turn on all
drives and press return.
WAITING for CALL SCREEN
The screen you see now means that
the BBS is waiting for a caller
to call. The F3 key will let you
log onto the board as if you had
just called at 1200 baud. This
is called LOCAL mode. We will look
at this later. Right now, press F1.
1) returns you to the waiting for
call screen
2) enters monster mode. This mode
can be entered from here, in which
it has no effect on the date, or
by time default. At 11:00pm, the BBS
automatically goes into monster mode.
It first updates the \Calls file (which
MUST be updated every 24hrs), changes
the date if needed,and validates
drive #8.
3) Zelch (Zap) term - when inside
the active term, F3 changes
automatically from graphics term to
standard ascii. If you are in the wrong
mode when calling another bbs, the
letters will be in the wrong case. To
find out which mode you are in at 
any time, press F2 and then return
to the term. The term will also let
you change baud rates from 300-500
(if you have chosen 300 baud mode or
are using a 300 baud modem). To return
to 300, either use this option again
or use the RESET Term option. The term
also allows PUNTER PROTOCOL in upload
and download,and will return to the
BBS whenever the RETURN TO BBS option
is chosen.
4) views your feedback left by users
5) views the Log. (\Log!) file.
Type 1 and F3. Hit return. Typing
"y" at the graphics prompt will let
you view the BBS as it is viewed in
color mode. Of course, no matter which
mode a caller chooses, everything
will be in color on the local side.
After the opening msg is viewed,
you may type "1" as your ID number
and "pass" as your password. Your
password is changable from within
the BBS.
  If a user is calling for the first
time, he will type "new" at the
ID prompt and will go through the
new user process. You may want to
log on as a dummy user and then
delete him later just to see how
the new user process works. See the
files for various files used in
this process. The "\newinfo" file
is viewed from the SysOp section
only..
 Now your window sets up. The window
never goes away and the information
therein is true only untill it changes
during the natural course of the BBS.
At prompts such as the COMMAND prompt
you see below, these commands are
available to the sysop locally 
only:
F1 - enter chat mode. This stops the
BBS exactly where it is and enters a
mode of free typing. F7 exits chat
mode and returns to WHEREEVER you were
previously. If things seem to have
stopped suddenly, it may be because you
mave entered chat mode. If you
have trouble exiting chat, try to
remember where you entered it from.
If it was a section where you had to
type "y" or "n", you may have to type
F7 to exit and then "y" or "n".
F2 - autologoff - this kicks any user
that is on-line off, no matter now
much time he has left.
F3 - This lets you temporarily
raise the access of a user.
F4 - Time burst gives the current
user 255 minutes online. Useful if
a user only has 1 minute left and you
want him to stay longer.
F5 - enters local mode while a
user is online. Inside this, you may
use the BBS without interference from
the user online. The user will remain
online, but is unaware that you
are doing anything. Entering chat
mode exits this function. Chat mode
also exits local mode which is entered
from the waiting for call screen.

INFO - Typing "I" or whatever letter
you chose for this function, views
the "\info" file.
FEEDBACK - lets a user leave feedback
to the sysop.
OFF - lets a user log off your BBS.
CHAT PAGE - makes a noise that alerts
the sysop to the fact that the current
user wishes for the sysop to enter chat
mode with him.
STATUS - views the current status of
the user online.
BAUD CHANGE - lets a user who has
called originally at 300-500 baud
to change his baud rate.
VOTE - lets the user vote on the
current subject. This section is
edited from the SYSOP section
LIBRARY - lets a user view your
LIBRARY or TEXT files
EMAIL - lets a user send mail to
another user or recieve mail for
himself. The Userlist function
herein is the same available from
the SYSOP section and the COMMAND
level.
USERLIST - at the USERLIST prompt,
you may press RETURN to view
the entire membership file. Typing
a number starts the viewing at
the ID number of the user equal to
the number given. Typing a series of
letters here will force the userlist
function to search the userlist for
users whose handles begin with those
letters and, if any are found, those
users are viewed.
EDITOR - this lets a user change
his password and:
hi msg # - every message posted in
the message base recieves a 
consecutively larger number. This
number currently represents the
number given to the last message a user
has read or posted. This way,
messages will appear NEW to the user
because they have a number assigned
to them which is HIGHER then the number
given to the highest msg he has
accually read. This number may be 
lowered though, thus making msgs with
lower numbers appear new to the user.
default baud rate - if a user has
a 300 baud modem but wishes to change
to 320 baud every time he calls your
BBS, he may change this number to 320.
Now, when he calls the BBS, the BBS
will automatically prompt him to change
to 320 baud.Then he doesn't have to
use the BAUD CHANGE command every time
he calls; it is executed automatically
and at the baud he himself
has requested.
 Other functions available from
the COMMAND prompt are:
SUB SECTION - this section holds
your online programs. From here,
you can Load an online program
from the current Sub Section. Or
List Sub Sections, change to a
different one and load a Prg from
THAT sub section.In each Sub Section
is a menu of On-Line programs in
that current section available
with the "$" command. This views
the "\section X" file described
above.
After a On-Line program is done,
it will usualy return to the
COMMAND section.
NOTE: Typing "/" and RETURN gives you
and menu at almost every main part
of the BBS
TRANSFER or UD section.
This part of your BBS also
has different sections containing
different files listed with the
"$" command. These programs though,
are downloaded and uploaded with
the NEW PUNTER PROTOCOL instead
of run. The About file function
lets you view the file description
file for a file in the current
UD section.
This SEQ file is written whenever
someone uploads a file to the BBS.
The description is read by going to
the UD section containing the file
in question, typing "a" and the
exact filename of the file you wish
information about. The filename
is discovered by typing "$" and
viewing the directory.
All UD files as well as LIBRARY
file for that matter appear on the
drive designated for that purpose.
UD program filenames may be up to
14 chars long but no longer.
SYSOP SECTION - from here you can
preform the following functions:
D)isk channel - this is a dirrect
link to your disk drives. All 
regular dos commands are available
from here as well as:
w:filename  - use the msg mkr to
write the SEQ file "filename"
e:filename - load the SEQ file
"filename" and then edit that file
from within the msg mkr.
This file may not be more then 50 lines
long.
@ - view the status of the current
drive
RETURN - on a blank line without
typing anything else will return
you to the SYSOP promt.
$ - views the directory 
$:argument*  - views all files
starting with the letters "argument".
ex: $:\mail* views all mail files (if
you are on the mail device drive)
% - counts all files
%:arg* - counts all files beginning
with the letters "arg"
@:filename - views the seq file 
"filename"
To change drives, type the device
number of the drive you wish to
change to and press return.
Other functions in the sysop section
are:
E)dit user - lets you edit any
user except the user online. Pressing
RETURN at an option concerning the
user makes no change to that option.
The variables are used as follows:
Var 0 - Hi Msg #
Var 1 - Hi Msg #
Var 2 - Default baud rate
Var 3 - Uploads done
Var 4 - Downloads done
Var 5 - Sig that this user is SigOp
of (see the msg base). this is
a number from 1 - # of sigs. If
a person has SigOp control of ALL
sigs, this number is 100.
To Delete a user, change his password
to some garbage and his handle must be
"EMPTY" exactly. In Uppercase.
VOTE EDITOR - lets you change
aspects of the Vote section. Such
as : 
Title : simple title of the voting
        question.
Response # : # of possible voting
             choices
Option : choice the user is given 
         while he is voting.
Result : a look at the results of
         choosing this option. Only
         9 options/results may be given
         ex : Option : yes
              Result : voted yes.
Q-quit S-Save
Other options in the SYSOP Section
M)embers file creator - lets you
update the "\members" file. This
file holds a list of all users.
Use this function daily.
T)ime/Date Editor - lets you edit
the current Time and Date
-----MESSAGE BASE
Here is where msgs are posted in
organized sections called Sigs.
RETURN - hitting RETURN lets you
view the NEXT message in that Sig
Change Sigs is done by holding
down the shift key and hitting the
letter of the Sig you wish to enter.
ex: shft-a to enter sig A (which is
also sig 1 in other ways)
LIST SIGS - lists the sigs available
SCAN MSGS - scans the msgs posted.
READ MSGS - views a msg and the replys
of that msg. If the user reading the
msg has post access, he can reply
to the msg he is reading also.
POST - this lets a user POST a message
thus starting a new msg which can be
replyed to. The msg cycling rules
mentioned above are put into work 
here.
NEW MSGS - views the msgs which are
new to the current user. These msgs
must be located within the current
Sig.
ALL NEW - works its way through each
Sig, checking for new msgs
along the way and viewing them if
they are found.
EDITOR - this is available to SUBOPS
only. A SUBOP or SIGOP is defined
by making the var 5 of a user equal
to the Sig # (ex var 5 = 1 if the
user is a SUBOP of Sig 1).
The SUBOPS can delete msgs and 
individual responses to msgs as well
as edit the \sigmsg file for the
current sig. This makes the Sig a
user is a SigOp of, his "property"
because of his powers over the
appearence and msgs therein.

MESSAGE MAKER - this is the part
of the program that alows you to
write SEQ files who's filename is
determined before this part of the
program is entered.
The commands herein are explained
in the "\msgmkr help" file which
is read by typing "/h" and hitting
RETURN on a blank line 

Lastly, files in this BBS can
be aborted with the space bar
and paused with the home key (any
key resumes after home is pressed).
Enjoy!
