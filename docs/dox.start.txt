            The Equipment

   The only equipment REQUIRED are
one disk drive, and a auto answer modem
Optional are a printer for the LOG
(device 4), and extra drives (devices
8 - 11).

               Disks??

   Your complete BBS system will have
one SYSTEM disk (containing the BBS,
boot file, editors, configurer, etc.)
This disk should NOT be in your drive
while your BBS is on-line.

   When you set up your BBS, you can
have up to 4 drives with anything you
like to be stored on them. The
exception is your MAIN data disk.
This disk will be in device 8 and will
hold all main files. Other file types
(UD section, Msg base, Mail, Text
files) can also be set to device 8 but
are optional.

   The disks you have set in any other
drives act as data disks and can have
other functions of the BBS rerouted to
them (individual sigs, mail, etc.).

           GETTING STARTED!

   Included on your system disk is a
program to set up some example files
for your MAIN and data disks. These
files can be edited as needed.

LOAD "CONFIG 2.4" ,8

SEARCHING FOR CONFIG 2.4
LOADING
READY.
RUN

  You will now see an opening screen
and a prompt to press RETURN. Because
this does not configure to your personal
desires and only sets some example
values, it will only set up for drive   
eight. All files can be set
to your personal needs later.
Drive 8 can either have a
formatted or unformatted disk inside.

  When this is done, press return and
answer the questions very carefully.
Your handle is up to 17 characters,
name: 17 chars, phone: 8 chars, pass: 8
This is any comb. of upper or lowercase
letters that should be known to YOU
only and not given out.

  Now the program should begin creating
the major BBS files. Lastly, it
will ask you to copy all files
beginning with "\prg." or "\pgm."
from your system disk to data disk.
I recommend Super Kit or Fast Hack'em.

          Off-line editor!

LOAD "EDITOR 2.4" ,8

SEARCHING FOR EDITOR 2.4
LOADING
READY.
RUN

NOTE: Any reference to the "DATA DISK"
refers to all data disks being put in
their proper drives!

  From this program you can change any
of the example values. Lets look
around... hit 0 from the main menu.
0) Edit main level options
1) Main Command Options
    This option alows you to change the
the letter typed to access a command 
as well as the access level required
(or higher) to use the option. To edit
any option, press the number next to it
NOTE: if you change anything be sure to
change the coresponding menus. In this
case, "\mainmenu x" (x = access
level 0 - 9) will hold the main level
options. Type "q" when done editing.

1) Edit msg mkr options

    This alows you to edit the command
letters for the BBS message writer
options. These functions are typed as
*(letter)(RETURN)
The functions not listed that are set
in permanently are:
*w (word wrap toggle)
*u (graphics/upper-lower toggle)
*h (help file-see below)

   A list of these commands should be
included in the file "\msg mkr help".


2) Edit msg base options

    This section is devoted to the
command letters for your msg base and
the access level required to use them.
Msg delete and resp delete should be
reserved for those with a higher access
only if you do not plan to have SubOps.
                                        
3) NAME OF BBS
4) Mail Device

   Here is the device number (8-11) for
your electronic mail.


5) Sig System

   This is a very important part of
your BBS system and should be edited
ONLY ONCE. The only changes that may
not effect the current status of your
msg base would be the adding of sigs.
Maximum Messages refers to the number
of individual subjects that will be
accepted in a sig at one time. Each msg
responses are tagged to the end of the
subjects and should not be considered
in this option.

6) UD Editor
7) Time/Calls editor

   This is where you edit the number of
calls PD, and amount of time allowed
on-line per call. All new users (first
time callers) are given level 0.

8) Library Device
   Here is the device number (8-11) for 
your TEXT or LIBRARY files.

9) UD options editor
   This section is for editing the      
command letters and access levels for
the UD section
P) On-line PRG section.
This is for editing the number
and access level for your on-line
prgs. (See below). Two are included
with your system disk. A VOTE editor
(See the SysOp section on part two
of the dox for info on using this
program) and a Time Gambler (Inst
included in the file "\timeinst". This
file should be copied to your data disk
from your system as well (drive 8)).

Q) Quit- USE THIS OPTION ONLY IF YOU
DON'T WANT YOUR CHANGES STORED!!!

S) Save and Quit- Save the file
"\variables" with all of the
information in this section. This file
along with all menus are MAIN data disk
files.
OPTION 2 from the main menu

   This is the editor for the userlog
on your Main data disk.

1) Create new user log

    This completely erases and
re-writes the userlog as done in the
configurer.

2) Edit userlog

    This is the option to edit an
individual user. This off-line editor
allows you to edit EVERY aspect of a
users information. The variables
mentioned (of which only 0 thru 5 are
used now) are numbers up to 4 chars.


3) Display users

4) Add a User

   This is used to add a user wherever
there is an opening. Openings are
assigned as follows.

      1) Any record that has not been
written to already.
      2) Any record which has a handle
of "EMPTY".

5) Exit

MAIN OPTION 3

   EACH SIG YOU HAVE CREATED IN THE MSG
MUST HAVE A SIG FILE. USING THIS OPTION
WILL ERASE PREVIOUS RECORDS FOR THAT
SIG!

             What's What

    Put your MAIN data disk in drive 8
and load the directory. Here are the
names of files you should see with a
description of what they are. Depending
some files will or will not be present.

started with a pound sign showing they
are MAIN data disk files and they
should not be downloaded.
